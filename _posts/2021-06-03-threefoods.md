title: Three Foods That Deserve a Place in Your Diet
---

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/threefoodsfinal.jpg)

These foods aren’t always appealing to a lot of people. It’s easier just taking a flavoured supplement that covers the nutritional holes right?

<br/>

A major drawback to this approach is that supplements lack this amazing ‘food matrix’ – a collective relationship between a bunch of different nutrients that complement each other and offer much greater benefit than if these nutrients were consumed individually.
<br/>

This food matrix usually results in favourable amounts/ratios of various vitamins and minerals!

<br/>

It’s a little bit more work to find ways of including these foods in your diet, but hopefully you'll see it as something worthwhile by the end of this post.

<br/>

So what are they?

**1. Fermented Foods**
=============

Think sauerkraut, kombucha, tempeh, kefir, kimchi, yogurt and so on.

<br/>

As an example, let’s look at all of the good stuff that happens when milk is fermented (such as kefir):

<br/>

  -Results in increased antioxidant activity (you know how good antioxidants are)
  -Some studies show a blood-pressure lowering effect!
  -Increased vitamin content (Folate, Vitamin K, Riboflavin)
  -Improved protein digestibility (it’s easier for your body to digest the protein)
  -Results in a reduction in lactose intolerance (for all those who can’t stomach dairy)
  -Delivers lots of probiotics!
  *(Melini et al., 2019)*

<br/>

If you’re eating grains/breads and suspect you’re a little gluten intolerant, the fermentation process can help with reducing your stomach issues while simultaneously increasing vitamin content and antioxidant activity.

<br/>

Some other impressive benefits the process of fermentation delivers:

<br/>
  -Can improve the taste and texture of the food
  -Can reduce foodborne pathogens (less chance of food poisioning)
  -Can remove less ideal parts of  foods (such as phtytic acid)
  -Improvement in your gut health due to all of the probiotics (with all the research on gut health you can understand how beneficial that will be for your total health)
  *(Bell et al., 2018)*
<br/>
<br/>

**2. Bone Broth**
====================================

You’ve probably heard the rave about supplements such as collagen, glycine, glutamine and so on. Supplements like these have been shown to be effective for numerous things, just search them on ‘Examine.com’ and see their various benefits.

<br/>

An even better way to get all of these different supplements in a single package (where they work synergistically) is through the consumption of bone broth.

<br/>

One of the main components of bone broth (responsible for its ‘jelly like’ consistency) is gelatin. Gelatin is the cooked version of collagen.

<br/>

Collagen/gelatin is awesome for your skin, but it’s also awesome for joint health:

<br/>
>*The combination of gelatin + vitamin C an hour before exercise was shown to increase collagen synthesis  (beneficial for your connective tissue = injury repair, injury prevention and improved performance) (Shaw et al., 2016).*
<br/>

Furthermore, if you’re familiar with the work of Weston A Price, who studied different cultures, their nutrition and subsequent health, you know they are big proponents of bone broth:
<br/>
>*“Gelatin was valued for its medicinal benefits for thousands of years and was long considered a panacea for everything from skin and joint disorders to digestive distress to heart ailments.” – Weston A Price Foundation*

<br/>
Some other impressive components of bone broth include proline and glycine:

<br/>
>*Glycine is a precursor of things like creatine! It’s important for your immune system, it plays a role as a neurotransmitter, it assists your digestion/the absorption of fats, it can have anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity and is important for RNA and DNA pathways (epigenetics) (Razak et al., 2017).*

<br/>

>*And there’s evidence that it helps your sleep quality (Kawai et al., 2015).*

<br/>

>*Proline also has a large number of roles, contributing to protein synthesis, metabolism, wound healing and your immune response, among others. (Wu et al., 2011)*

<br/>

There’s also glutamine and a bunch of beneficial minerals!



**3. Organ Meat**
===================

I don’t have much to say about organ meat other than it has to be one of the most nutrient-dense foods there are.
<br/>

To list all of the nutrients and their benefits would cover the next couple of pages.

<br/>
If you think you may be missing a key nutrient in your diet, something like well-sourced (free range/organic/antibiotic-free) chicken liver will cover your bases, and this has the potential to help you feel a lot better too.

<br/>

**So how do we start incorporating these foods?**
=====================

These foods very rarely showed up in my diet before I started diving into the health and fitness world. When I started trying to incorporate them I tried them on their own, I had a big mug of bone broth (didn’t enjoy that), I tried a spoonful of sauerkraut which was even worse, and then I tried cooking up chicken liver with onions and mushrooms and could hardly stomach it.

<br/>

Some more palatable ways I have since incorporated all of these foods into my diet:

<br/>
  -Try having some sauerkraut or other fermented vegetable alongside your eggs. For me personally, after some time getting used to it, I can now no longer enjoy eggs without some    accompanying sauerkraut.
  
<br/>
  -Some people enjoy sipping a straight up mug of bone broth but I found that cooking the majority of my meals in it, and especially throwing it in the slow cooker, makes my meals   considerably tastier. I also tend to use it to heat up many of my meals.
  
<br/>
  -My solution to eating chicken liver is in the form of pâté or mixed in with beef mince.
  
<br/>

There are a number of different recommendations and ways of incorporating this food, it’s just about finding ones that taste best for you.
<br/>

Another consideration is that these foods should be sourced with an emphasis on quality. The bone broth should ideally be from organic bones and the same goes for making sure the chicken livers/organ meat is from free-range and antibiotic-free animals.
<br/>

Nutritional deficiencies can wreak considerably more havoc than you may suspect. There’s definitely a place for specific testing and supplementing to address these deficiencies – I think it’s very important.
<br/>

However, if you’re generally healthy and not looking to go down the testing and specific supplementation route, these food additions may fill some nutritional holes in your diet and contribute positively to your health and fitness pursuits.
