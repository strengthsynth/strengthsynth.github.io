Building muscle, it’s not just for bodybuilders and people looking to get ‘jacked’. Its vital contribution towards health should have every individual chasing more!

<br/>

Stepping outside on the northern beaches and you see that running and jogging tend to be a popular choice for those looking to get healthier. Don’t get me wrong, finding ways to incorporate aerobic training is great and should play a part in everyone’s exercise routine, however, it’s not going to be enough to build muscle (as with a lot of the trending fitness methods)

<br/>

Why would you need to build muscle?

<br/>

It may just be the best way for you to finally reach your ‘body goals’, but more importantly, transform your health.

<br/>

**Body Composition**
=============
You’re just going to look better. Whether that’s more ‘toned’, ‘fit’, or whatever adjective you want to use, adding muscle achieves it, not starving yourself and running yourself into the ground. 

<br/>

What’s this got to do with your health? This favourable change in your body composition is generally going to improve a number of health markers as you’ll be carrying more muscle and less fat.

<br/>

Psychologically, this change in body composition can also be a huge advantage as there are a number of psychological effects from being happier with the way you look (such as improved confidence and greater body satisfaction). Naturally, a healthier mind is going to result in a healthier body.

<br/>

For example:

<br/>

>*Haines and Neumark-Sztainer (2006) showed that experiencing body dissatisfaction can result in the development of obesity and eating disorders. On the other end of the spectrum, having greater amounts of self compassion can influence your mental and physical health and even help you adhere to your training! (M Bigliassi, 2020).*

<br/>

**Off-Setting/Avoiding Sarcopenia**
====================================

Sarcopenia can begin as early as your 30’s! (Walston, 2012)

<br/>

Sarcopenia is essentially the loss of muscle and the loss of strength or physical
performance that accompanies it. The issue with this is that when you have
significant muscle loss, your risk of illness increases (muscle is important for
your immune system), you lose function (body ages faster), and you’re more susceptible
to a number of chronic conditions.

<br/>

>*“Strength declines by 10% to 15% per decade up to the age of 70 years, when the
loss accelerates to 25% to 40% per decade.” (Siparsky et al., 2014)*

<br/>

The good news is that your muscle can be maintained and even improved
through a solid strength and conditioning program that involves working large
muscle groups with a relatively heavy load and improving power.

<br/>

**Metabolism**
===================

Your muscle plays a major role in how you store and use the energy from your
food, such as glucose and fats. This is important for maintaining your insulin
sensitivity (avoiding diabetes), providing energy (avoiding fatigue), and
contributes to a body composition that equates with great health.

<br/>

**Immunity and Resilience**
==============

It’s well established that physical exercise has positive effects for your immune
system, but what about possessing more muscle?

<br/>

Granted these weren’t human studies, however a couple studies in animals may
suggest that muscle may play a role in boosting the immune response.

<br/>

>*“mice with more muscle mass were better able to cope with chronic viral infection
than those whose muscles were weaker.” (Wu et al., 2020)*

<br/>

>*“skeletal muscles help to keep the immune system functional in chronic diseases”
(Wu et al., 2020)*

<br/>

There are all kinds of challenges you may face in life, from surgeries to illnesses
and accidents.

<br/>

There have been numerous studies that show older individuals that are frail
(have less muscle mass) experience worse outcomes when faced with surgeries,
hospitilisations, cancer treatments and so on.

<br/>

>*Frailty was associated with higher hospital mortality and long-term mortality...
Frail patients were less likely to be discharged home than fit patients.
(Muscedere et al., 2017)*

<br/>

**Longevity Correlation**
================

Muscle mass is, in itself, a good predictor for survival in older individuals. A
study by Srikanthan & Karlamangla (2014) followed a large group of older
Americans over a number of years and concluded that:

<br/>

>*“Muscle mass, independent of fat mass and cardiovascular and metabolic risk
factors, is inversely associated with mortality risk in older adults”."

<br/>

In other words, the individuals who had more muscle mass lived longer.

<br/>

Now you have to take into account all of the other factors that could be
contributing to muscle mass that also promote longevity, however given the fact
that the study adjusted for risk factors such as C-V and metabolic health and this
clear relationship still exists (along with the roles of muscle mass as I’ve
outlined) you can’t go wrong with the addition of a little more muscle!

<br/>

**So how do we do it!?**
=====================

A few important points for effectively adding more muscle mass are summarised below (If you want the short version scroll to the bottom):

<br/>

*Lifestyle*: Managing sleep and stress better. Sleep is associated with how well
your dietary interventions work, how well you recover, the progress you make
and so on. If improving muscle mass is a priority for you, sleep has to be too.
Along the same lines, finding ways to manage stress better is also crucial. Stress
doesn’t differentiate and at some point you will need a down regulation of stress
to help you recover and see the gains you’ve been working for.

<br/>

*Diet*: Without getting into the ins and outs of dietary choices, I believe the
simplest thing you can do for improving your muscle mass in placing an
emphasis on the amount of good quality protein you’re consuming. There’s
evidence that the aging population should be having anywhere between 1-2g’s of
protein per kg of bodyweight! (Lonnie et al., 2018).

<br/>

*Training (which I’d like to address a little deeper for this post)*:

<br/>

First of all, you need to **experience enough of a stimulus that forces you to
adapt (intensity has to be great enough) and be progressively increasing
this stimulus over time (progressive overload).**

<br/>

Unfortunately, doing your burpees into jumping jacks then down into a
mountain climber may not be enough of a stimulus to grow muscle. Doing the
same workout with the exact same weights for weeks on end probably isn’t
helping you grow muscle either.

<br/>

So what would this look like? Learning specific movements and
measuring/tracking those movements so that you know how much you’ve done,
and what you need to do to keep progressing (providing more and more of a
stimulus over time). There are various ways you can progress in your movements,
from increasing your range of motion to simply adding more weight. It won’t
necessarily be a linear process, but without tracking and measuring it’s a blind
pursuit.

<br/>

Yes, this means if your trainer is taking you through a session without a book and
pen in their hand, you’re probably not getting much closer to where
you want to be.

<br/>

You should also **stick to a specific program for an extended period of time.**

<br/>

You need time to be able to improve; whether that’s adding weight, doing more
sets, experiencing less pain, moving better or whatever way you’re tracking
progress. If you’re completely changing your workout week to week, program
hopping, or continually introducing the latest exercise you saw on instagram,
then you’re not going to improve at anything and will struggle with your muscle-
building pursuit.

<br/>

There is general agreement that when it comes to building muscle, one of the
most important factors is to be **increasing volume over time** (Essentially
coming back to the first point).

<br/>

This means it is important to gradually start doing more work. You could achieve
this by hitting a few more reps, increasing the weight, or simply performing
more sets as you progress through the program.

<br/>

**An important note:** When you start increasing the amount of work you’re doing,
try not to let the quality of work go in the opposite direction. Quality and
quantity are key.

<br/>


*Still not too sure?*
=================================================================
<br/>

For someone new to resistance training, here's a pretty simple way to start:

<br/>
1. Choose some resistance training movements that feel right for you:
<br/>
<br/>
-A 'Knee-dominant' Squat movement (Eg. Heels elevated Goblet Squat)
<br/>
-A Vertical push and pull movement (Eg. Single-arm Kettlebell Press, Lat Pull-Down)
<br/>
-A Horizontal push and pull movement (Eg. Push-Up, Single-arm Kettlebell Row)
<br/>
-A 'Hip-dominant' Hinge movement (Eg. Deadlift)
<br/>
-Some ab movements (Eg. Heavy single-arm carry and a plank)
<br/>
-A Lateral Movement (Eg. Lateral Squat)

<br/>

<br/>
2. Make these movements hard enough for you that you can’t do that movement
more than 20 times straight. Repeat all movements 2 times around to start off with.

<br/>
<br/>
3. Record what you did.

<br/>
<br/>
4. In between sessions, eat more protein, try to sleep well, get sunlight exposure
and find strategies to cope with stress a little better.

<br/>
<br/>
5. Next session do the same workout but try to beat your previous records. This
could be done by doing more reps, adding more weight, having more range of
motion, Increasing the time it takes you to do the movement, doing more rounds
(sets) and so on... If you can’t beat it one way, try to beat it in another way.

<br/>
<br/>
6. Once you start needing heavier weights, more sets, and more difficult exercises, break up the movements into separate sessions throughout the week. For example, you could start doing a 'push' session (vertical and horizontal pushing movements, + throw in some arm work) on day 1, a 'leg' session on day 2 (knee and hip dominant movements), and a 'pull' session (vertical and horizontal pulling movements, + ab work) on day 3. You could also keep doing full body workouts on each day but break up the number of sets you do among the sessions. There are multiple ways you can organise your training – play around with different variations and see what feels best.

<br/>
<br/>
7. Try to get at least 3 sessions in a week while leaving adequate time in between
sessions to feel somewhat recovered.

<br/>
<br/>
8. Repeat until you’re not progressing anymore and then you can start worrying
about diving deeper into ‘the optimal’ ways of building muscle that everyone
loves to talk about.
