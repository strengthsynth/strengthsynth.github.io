title: Sunlight – Friend, Not Foe

I know from first-hand experience the detrimental effects of not getting enough sunlight.

Moving from sunny Australia, I went to study and play basketball in a city that sat on Lake Superior in the state of Wisconsin, USA. This was definitely different from what I was used to. Alongside the freezing weather, there was also a considerable lack of sunlight throughout the colder months of the year.

It was a great experience, meeting amazing people and making great friends but, mentally, I felt depressed, anxious, fatigued, and physically I kept getting injured (persistent tendinopathy in my knees and stress fractures in my shins), I kept getting sick, I felt slow and, all around, my performance didn’t feel the way it should’ve.

Transferring to a school down in sunny Georgia two years later, I felt like a new man.

While in Wisconsin, I had not yet dived into all things health and fitness so I didn’t even consider using light devices, Vitamin D supplementation, still exposing myself to outside light etc. Once I had explored this area, in hindsight I realised I could chalk a lot of the issues I was having to probably having extremely low Vitamin D levels, and not getting enough sunlight.

But what does this have to do with you? Well, the sun gets a bad rap due to the message of avoidance because of skin ageing and cancer; However, what follows are the reasons I believe getting a little more sun exposure will contribute to **transforming your *health, fitness, and performance***:

**Vitamin D**
=============
This is the most obvious benefit of getting sunlight exposure. It benefits our: hormones, muscle growth, gut health, respiratory health, oral health, immune system and disease prevention; showing a reduction in the risk of C-V disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome separately of supplementation. Interestingly enough, the vitamin D that is produced in your skin can enhance DNA repair and paradoxically lower your risk of cancer! (Hoel et al., 2016)

There are thousands of genes in the body that have a receptor for Vitamin D.

In other words, if you’re not getting adequate Vitamin D, you’re doing your body a huge disservice! (As I found out)
Now Vitamin D supplementation is probably going to be useful for a lot of people but, at the same time, getting adequate Vitamin D from the sun is going to be superior to getting it from supplement form.

>*“supplements are not an effective substitute for adequate sun exposure” (Hoel et al., 2016)*

If you do live in a geographical location where there isn’t much sun, this is where it becomes even more important to consume Vitamin D-rich foods such as pasture-raised egg yolks, wild-caught salmon, liver etc.

**Sleep/Melatonin/Circadian Rhythm**
====================================

Melatonin is a key hormone involved in your circadian rhythms (the cycles of many inner processes) and thus a big contributor to how well you sleep.

Getting some light exposure (from the sun) in the morning and evening (sunrise/sunset is ideal) can assist in your nighttime melatonin production, helping you enter into sleep more easily, along with the other benefits associated with improved circadian rhythms (think mood, energy levels, etc). This hormone also contributes significantly to an improved immune system (Mead, 2008).

>*Scientists such as Dr Huberman describe morning light exposure as being a ‘game changer’, supporting your mood, digestion, cognitive and physical performance. 
The various kinds of wavelengths/types of light that are emitted from the sun are always going to be superior to the ones you’re receiving from indoor LED lighting.*

**Immune Function**
===================

We’ve already looked at how Melatonin and Vitamin D have positive effects on your immune system, but there are also components of the sun, such as the red light/near infrared light wavelengths that have beneficial effects. Either way, through whatever mechanism, there’s evidence of sun exposure to:

Prevent autoimmune diseases, treat skin disorders, and despite what you’ve been told, reduce melanoma risk! (Mead, 2008)
