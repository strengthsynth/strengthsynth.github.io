title: Sunlight – Friend, Not Foe

I know from first-hand experience the detrimental effects of not getting enough sunlight.

Moving from sunny Australia, I went to study and play basketball in a city that sat on Lake Superior in the state of Wisconsin. This was definitely different from what I was used to. Alongside the freezing weather, there was also a considerable lack of sunlight throughout the colder months of the year. It was a great experience, meeting amazing people and making great friends, but mentally I felt depressed, anxious, fatigued and physically I kept getting injured (persistent tendinopathy in my knees and stress fractures in my shins), I kept getting sick, I felt slow, and all around my performance didn’t feel the way it should’ve. 

Transferring to a school down in sunny Georgia two years later, and I felt like a new man.

While in Wisconsin, I had not yet dived into all things health and fitness so I didn’t even consider using light devices, Vitamin D supplementation, still exposing myself to outside light etc. Once I had explored this area, in hindsight I realised I could chalk a lot of the issues I was having to probably having extremely low Vitamin D levels, and not getting enough sunlight.

But what does this have to do with you? Well, the sun gets a bad rap due to the message of avoidance because of skin aging and cancer. However, what follows are the reasons I believe getting a little more sun exposure will contribute to **transforming your health, fitness, and performance**:
